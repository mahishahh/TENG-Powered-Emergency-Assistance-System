TENG Powered Emergency Assistance System

This project demonstrates a **self-powered emergency alert wearable** using a **Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG)** to generate AC voltage, which is rectified to power IR LEDs. The system detects taps through IR signal interruption and transmits real-time alerts via Bluetooth using a Nordic microcontroller.

Features
- TENG-based energy generation using PTFE and polyimide layers
- IR LED and receiver setup for tap-based signal detection
- BLE-based communication to mobile application via Nordic nRF52832
- Arduino code for receiver logic and IR event testing
- Compact, battery-free, and wearable hardware prototype
