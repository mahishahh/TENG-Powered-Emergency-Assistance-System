# TENG-Powered Emergency Assistance System

A self-powered emergency signaling device engineered using triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) principles to generate electricity from mechanical motion, enabling real-time distress signal transmission without external power.

## 🔍 Overview

This project aims to develop a **wearable emergency signaling device** powered by mechanical energy using triboelectric materials (PTFE and aluminum). The system generates a usable electrical signal upon motion and activates an IR-based alert signal, making it suitable for remote or critical situations such as natural disasters, industrial environments, or health emergencies.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Triboelectric Energy Harvesting:** Utilizes PTFE-Aluminum contact pair for mechanical-to-electrical energy conversion.
- **Self-Powered System:** No external power supply required; generates up to **12V DC output**.
- **Emergency Signaling:** Activates IR LED and transmits distress signal via microcontroller.
- **Wearable Design:** Compact and low-power setup for easy integration into personal safety equipment.
