## Project Overview

The device leverages **triboelectric charge generation** from PTFE and aluminum layers to produce DC output without external power. It integrates an IR signaling system controlled by a microcontroller to enable real-time emergency alerts in the field.

This project was developed as a **capstone project** under the guidance of faculty at **IIT Indore**, with an emphasis on practical engineering application, sustainability, and low-power operation.

## Key Features

- **Self-Powered**: Generates 12V from physical motion—no battery needed  
- **Reliable Signaling**: Activates IR LED alert detectable by receiver modules  
-  **Compact & Wearable**: Lightweight form factor for portability and usability  
- **Bluetooth Integration**: Nordic nRF52832 microcontroller enables wireless communication  
- **Proof of Concept Validated**: Demonstrated consistent operation across repeated cycles
